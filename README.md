# Airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of the Airbnb platform. It aims to recreate core features such as user authentication, property listings, booking systems, and reviews.

## Project Goals
- Understand the full-stack development process
- Learn collaboration using Git and GitHub
- Apply object-oriented programming principles
- Build and structure scalable web applications

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Flask or Django (to be decided)
- **Database**: MySQL or SQLite
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## UI/UX Design Planning
 **Design Goals**
- Create an intuitive booking flow that minimizes user effort.

- Maintain visual consistency across all pages and components.

- Ensure fast loading times through efficient design and performance optimization.

- Prioritize mobile responsiveness for users on all devices.

  **Key Features**
- Property Search & Filtering: Users can easily find accommodations based on location, price, availability, etc.

- Detailed Property View: View images, descriptions, reviews, amenities, and booking options.

- Secure Checkout Process: Fast and reliable booking experience with secure payment options.

- User Authentication: Login/Signup for personalized access and booking history.

 **Primary Pages**

- *Property Listing* - View	Displays a grid of available properties. Includes filters (price, location, availability) and a search bar. Each listing shows image, price, title, and rating.
- *Listing Detailed* - View	Provides detailed information about a selected property, including image gallery, description, amenities, map, booking form, and reviews.
